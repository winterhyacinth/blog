# Velvet Bakery ₊˚⊹♡ 

## why i made it
* i made this to explore backend development! i've mainly focused on the visuals of sites, so it was nice to make something non-static

* i made it about the recipes me and my grandma have baked, since well....i love baked goods!
 
## what it does
* within the site, you can click on the various cards in order to view different recipes. there are various hover and transition effects to make the site more fun!

* in the backend, i (the admin) can write in posts, the related image, and a date for it to easily appear on the main page -- much easier than writing everything out in html 

## how i made it
* i used bootstrap, CSS, and HTML for the frontend development and django/python for backend

* the cookie pixel art was created on pixquare

* i spent ~8 hours  coding it :') as well as around 2hr setting up pythonanywhere, making the icon, and adding recipes in 

## struggles & learning
* i've never really done any backend before, and django was overall very confusing!! (i'm proud i made a non-static site, though!)

* having to migrate and push more frequently just to test how it would look in pythonanywhere definitely was not my favorite...i think i prefer just brute force css and html, though i understand the appeal of bootstrap & django's template structure

* i even had to import ckeditor after a long struggle in order to add line breaks and better formatting to my posts

* now i think i have a better grasp on how django and more complicated backend systems work, as well as how to upload them through methods like pythonanywhere (yippee!)
